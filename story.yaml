    It's a beautiful fall day in New York. After a surprisingly easy subway\n\
    ride, you walk into your new office building and dev room. One of your\n\
    new teammates greets you with a friendly smile and introduces himself as\n\
	Luke. Luke lets you know that the team stand-up starts in 5 minutes. You\n\
	have no idea what he is talking about.\n"
