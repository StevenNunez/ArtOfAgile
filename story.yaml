    Good morning! It is your first day of work at your new job. You have\n\ 
    been hired as a team member in an agile software development shop.\n\
    \n\
    You're excited about being a member of an agile team for the first\n\
    time ever and nervous about what you've gotten yourself into. Let's\n\
    see how it all unfolds.\n"

    :response: "\"Hahah, don't look so scared,\" Luke says."
    :text: Smile politely and say nothing. You'll Google "stand-up" later.

    :response: "\"Oh, right! This is your first Agile team - how exciting!\" Luke says."
    :text: You ask, "What's a stand-up?"

    :response: "\"Hey man, that's the way to the kitchen. The conference room\n\
	  is this way!\" Luke says."
    :text: "You consider making yourself scarce in 5 minutes. Change is\n\
       \thard and you have no desire to be part of a \"stand-up\". You\n\
       \tdrop your head and head to the kitchen."

    It's a beautiful fall day in New York. After a surprisingly easy subway\n\
    ride, you walk into your new office building and dev room. One of your\n\
    new teammates greets you with a friendly smile and introduces himself as\n\
    Luke. Luke lets you know that the team stand-up starts in 5 minutes. You\n\
    have no idea what he is talking about.\n"

    :response: "Luke comes over and says, \"I realize this is a lot to take in\n\
                but it's called stand-up for a reason!"
    :text: Sit down on the nearest chair. Man, the first day is tiring!

    :response: "Luke comes over and says, \"You're part of the team here so come\n\
                on over to the board."
    :text: Stand off to the side, you really don't feel part of the team yet.

    :response: The team opens up the circle to include you and you step in.
    :text: Join your new team at the story board.

    He continues, \"Stand-up is a daily meeting in which the team focuses\n\
    on getting the iteration done. Many teams have their own formats for\n\
    this meeting. We usually focus on communicating to each other what\n\
    progress we made yesterday and what we learned in the process, also\n\
    what is impeding us today and how confident we are in meeting our\n\
    commitment.\"\n\
    \n\
    You wonder what iteration and commitment mean but decide to ask that\n\
    later. You find your way to the kitchen, grab a glass of water and go\n\
    back to the dev room, where the rest of the team has begun to assemble\n\
    around the story board."

    :response: The team awkwardly responds to your awkwardness and seems confused.
    :text: You mumble something about being new so you have nothing to say.

    :response: "\"Good question!\" says Luke. \"We'll table that for after the meeting.\""
    :text: "You introduce yourself and ask \"What's a commitment?\"\n\
            \tBest to be open and honest."

    :response: "\"Dude! Not cool!\" Luke is unhappy."
    :text: "You start making up some project issues and also voice \n\
            \tconcern about making the commitment. You just want to fit in."
  :text: "\n\
    As you look around the dev room, your new \"home-away-from-home\", you\n\ 
    see a lot of graphs and charts, a board with a bunch of cards and\n\
    post-it stuck to it, family pictures, plants, posters, pictures of the\n\
    developers at McSorleys. You remind yourself to bring your plant and\n\
    a picture of Zeus, your chihuahua. One of the team members speaks up\n\
    and begins to talk about some things that happened yesterday and what\n\
    he is planning on working on today. He mentions some concerns he has\n\
    about making the commitment. There's that word again, you think. Other\n\ 
    team members take their turn around the circle giving similar reports\n\
    and now it is your turn. What do you say?\n"

    Everyone welcomes you to the team.  Your first stand-up is over! The\n\
    team disbands and heads out for lunch.\n"
