A Day in the Life of an Agilist 

Good morning!  It is your first day of work at your new job.  You have
been hired as a team member in an agile software development shop.
You wait excitedly to find out how your day will unfold in this new
role.

As you walk into your new work space, and one of your new team mates
greets you with a friendly smile and lets know that the team stand-up
starts in 5 minutes.  You ask, "Gee, what is a stand up?"  Your team
mate responds, "Well...you are new aren't you?"  <EXPLAIN STAND UP> You
grab a glass of water from the kitchen and go back to the team space
where the rest of the team has begun to assemble around the story
board.

One of the team members speaks up and begins to talk about things that
happened yesterday and what is going to happen today.  He also notes
some issues that are hindering his progress and gives his confidence
of how the iteration is going to go.  Other team members taker their
turn around the circle giving similar reports and now it is your turn.
You introduce yourself and express your excitement for working in this
new place.

The stand up ends and the team heads off to their various lunch spots.
